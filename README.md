# The Spaghetti

Spaghetti codes  - a fun term to describe a messy repository, codes.  
Yes that is correct, and no this is not an organised repository, or at least that is what I am trying to avoid.
<br />
By the time this repository is made on October, I am proudly, serving in Finnish Defense Force. The service marks my 9-year of living in Finland, 2014 - 2023.  
It was a great journey, that day when I went out to the world and learnt, many failures, but so much valuable and unique experience.  
<br />
I have so many stories to share, but not here.  
<br />
Long story short, during my service, I decide to make this reposity from my free time in order to refresh my coding skill. 

## The purpose
This project does not have any specific goal, nor serve anyone. 
<br />
This is to be made for fun, also can be seen as a blog / showcase where I deliver all of the knowledge I have gathered during my software development. 
<br />
Hence there are plenty of things I implements while I coded with my own thoughts and not rely on google, chatgpt, stackoverflow.   
<br />
On the other words, in this project, I focus solely on:  
<li>Crucial importance of clean code, provided it is made to give clear instruction of how to start the project for new users</li>
<li>Reusable components, helper functions</li>
<li>Maintenance NPM</li>
<li>Version control</li>
<li>Type control</li>
<li>Performance, Accessibility and Responsiveness</li>
<br/>
Technologies implemented in this project:
<li>Typescript</li>
<li>ReactJS</li>
<li>GraphQL</li>
<li>AWS S3, AWS AppSync</li>
<li>Libraries: zustand, Tailwindcss, React router v6.18.0, pure CSS</li>

## How to start the project  
Clone the project from github.  
Run terminal, run ```npm install```
Create env file in root folder, put your github token and github graphQL API URL.
Run ```npm start```

## Sum up
This project represents me.
