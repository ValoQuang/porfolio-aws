# The Spaghetti
By the time this repository is made from November, 2023, I am proudly, serving in Finnish Defense Force. The service marks my 9-year of living in Finland, 2014 - 2023.  
<br />
I have so many stories to share, but not here.  
<br />
Long story short, during my service, I decide to make this reposity from my free time in order to refresh my coding skill. 

## The purpose
This is to be made for fun, also can be seen as a blog / showcase where I deliver all of the knowledge I have gathered during my software development. 
<br />

## ON-GOING DEVELOPMENT, WHAT'S NEXT ?  
Lofi mini project.<br />
19.12.2023 till NEXT year <br />

2. Add Simply backend logic to save user profile, which can contain user mood, user setting (to be considered for details later)<br />
3. Refactor, clean up.

Best regards,
