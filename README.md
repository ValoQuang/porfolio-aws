# The Spaghetti - ON-GOING PROJECT

Spaghetti codes  - a fun term to describe a messy repository, codes.  
Yes that is correct, and no this is not an organised repository, or at least that is what I am trying to do, the repository as clean as possible .
<br />
Hi potential employers, my name is Quang, by the way.  
By the time this repository is made on October, I am proudly, serving in Finnish Defense Force. The service marks my 9-year of living in Finland, 2014 - 2023.  
It was a great journey, that day when I went out to the world and learnt, many failures, but so much valuable and unique experience.  
<br />
I have so many stories to share, but not here.  
<br />
Long story short, during my service, I decide to make this reposity from my free time. 

## The purpose

Yes, this project does not have any specific goal, nor serve anyone. 
<br />
This is to be made for fun, also the blog / showcase where I deliver all of the knowledge I have gathered during my software development. So there are plenty of things I implements while I coded with my own memories and not rely on google, chatgpt, stackoverflow.
<br />
On the other words, in this project, I focus solely on:  
<li>Crucial importance of clean code, even this README will try to be clean and professional</li>
<li>Reusable components, helper functions</li>
<li>Maintenance NPM</li>
<li>CI/CD</li>
<li>Version control</li>
<br/>
Technologies implemented in this project:
<li>Typescript</li>
<li>ReactJS</li>
<li>GraphQL</li>
<li>AWS S3, AWS AppSync</li>
<li>Libraries: zustand, Tailwindcss, React router v6.18.0</li>

## Sum up
This project, represent me.
<br />
Best regards,
