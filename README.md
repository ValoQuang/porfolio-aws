# The Spaghetti
Spaghetti codes  - a fun term to describe a messy repository, codes.  
<br />
By the time this repository is made on October, I am proudly, serving in Finnish Defense Force. The service marks my 9-year of living in Finland, 2014 - 2023.  
<br />
I have so many stories to share, but not here.  
<br />
Long story short, during my service, I decide to make this reposity from my free time in order to refresh my coding skill. 

## The purpose
This is to be made for fun, also can be seen as a blog / showcase where I deliver all of the knowledge I have gathered during my software development. 
<br />
Hence there are plenty of things I implements while I coded with my own thoughts and not rely on google, chatgpt, stackoverflow.   
<br />
On the other words, in this project, I focus solely on:  
<li>Crucial importance of clean code, provided it is made to give clear instruction of how to start the project for new users</li>
<li>Reusable components, helper functions</li>
<li>Maintenance NPM</li>
<li>Version control</li>
<li>Type control</li>
<li>Performance, Accessibility and Responsiveness</li>
<br/>
Technologies implemented in this project:
<li>Typescript</li>
<li>ReactJS</li>
<li>GraphQL</li>
<li>AWS S3, AWS AppSync, API Gateway, DynamoDB, Lambda Function</li>
<li>Libraries: zustand, Tailwindcss, React router v6.18.0, pure CSS</li>

## ON-GOING DEVELOPMENT, WHAT'S NEXT ?  
November, 2023 note.  
Simple Note taking with dynamoDB on AWS as database, also with Lambda function to notify whenever new notes are added.  
Host project on S3 Buckets.
Practice more on AWS.

## Sum up
This project represents me.
